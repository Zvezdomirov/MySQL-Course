# MySQL-Course

These are all of my solutions to the exercises from the course.

### Each directory contains:

### 1) lab - The exercises right after the lecture
	- Usually shorter, just so one can get to practice the concepts right away
	- Directory content:
		- Problem descriptions
		- Problem solutions

### 2) exercise - The homework exercises
	- Harder and more time-consuming, since they are for homework and have longer deadlines
	- Directory content:
		- Problem descriptions
		- Problem solutions
